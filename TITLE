# Reaction Timer Game

An Arduino-based multiplayer reaction time game using LEDs, push buttons, and LCD.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Components Used:
- Arduino UNO
- Push buttons (3)
- IR Sensors
- LEDs (3)
- LiquidCrystal LCD
- Buzzer (optional)
- Resistors, jumper wires, breadboard

## ðŸŽ® How It Works:
1. Players place their hands near IR sensors.
2. A random delay occurs.
3. LEDs light up â€” players press the buttons as fast as possible.
4. LCD shows reaction time and declares the winner.
